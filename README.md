## Build a Survey Tool

This week we practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. The project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.


## The problem

This week I run into some issues with npm installments and deploying site on Netlify. I solved it by:
1.Delete package-lock.json
2.Delete node_modules
3.Remove “eslint” from dependencies and/or devDependesies
4.Run npm install
5.Deploy it on Netlify again

I also needed to go back a few steps in what I built in order to have it work so if I had more time I would add the things I had to remove (audio & animations).
